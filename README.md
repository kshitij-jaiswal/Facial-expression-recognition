# Facial-expression-recognition
A convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. This project will classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). 


# STEPS TO FOLLOW:

1. Extract train and test images from data.rar file.
2. Install dependencies using
3. pip install pipenv
4. pipenv install
5. Run the jupyter notebook for training, model.json and model_weights.h5 files will be created after training.
6. Add the correct path to the video file in camera.py on line 11.
7. Now run pipenv run python3 main.py
